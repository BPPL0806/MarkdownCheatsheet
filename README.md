>## Headings
Hashtags (#) are used to create headings by putting them before the text of heading.  
It's used like headings from 1 to 6 (h1 - h6) in HTML - the more hashtags (max. 6) before text means smaller text. Heading with just 1 hashtag will have line under it that will seperate    
Text after 6 hashtags is smaller than regular one.  

`Example input:`
```markdown
### Heading with three hashtags
###### Heading with 6 hashtags
Regular text
```
`Output:`
### Heading with three hashtags
###### Heading with 6 hashtags
Regular text
